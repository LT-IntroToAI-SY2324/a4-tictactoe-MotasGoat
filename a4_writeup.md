# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    > For me the most difficult part of tictactoe was writing all of the win conditions because it caused me to kind of have to rework the way I was looking at the problem to be able to successfully code it.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    > The way I would add a computer player to the game would be by importing random and would use it to correspond to the indexes of the board. This player wouldn't be very good but it would still be a randomized computer player that could be used.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    > The way that I would make the computer "smarter" or make it make better moves would be by creating multiple if statements that would see if the player's move create possible ways for the player to win ex. two Xs in a row, the computer would place an O where the next X would be.
